## Synopsisüí°
What you should learn from this project:
vim
*  This is a simple implementation of the printf function that formats and prints data

## Description
printf format string refers to a control parameter used by a class of functions in the input/output libraries of C and many other programming languages. The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, but format specifiers, which start with a % character, indicate the location and method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters. 

* %c: Prints a single character.
* %s: Prints a string of characters.
* %d: Prints integers.
* %i: Prints integers.
* %b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
* %u: Prints unsigned integers.
* %x: Prints the hexadecimal representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase letters.

# Usage
* All the files are to be be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
* Complete your code with gcc ‚Äì Wall ‚Äì Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
* Include the ‚Äúholberton.h‚Äù header file on the functions using the _printf()
